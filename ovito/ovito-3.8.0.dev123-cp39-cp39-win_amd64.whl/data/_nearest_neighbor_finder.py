      To find all neighbors within a spherical cutoff region around another particle, 
      use :py:class:`CutoffNeighborFinder` instead.

    The constructor takes the requested number of nearest neighbors, *N*, and a :py:class:`DataCollection <ovito.data.DataCollection>`
    containing the input particles and the optional simulation cell.
    *N* must be a positive integer not greater than 64, which is the built-in maximum of neighbors supported by this class.

    .. note::

      Keep in mind that, if the system contains only *N* particles or less, and if the simulation does not use periodic boundary conditions, then the 
      neighbor finder will return less than the requested number of nearest neighbors.

    Once the :py:class:`!NearestNeighborFinder` has been initialized, you can call its :py:meth:`.find` method to
    iterate over the sorted list of nearest neighbors of a given central particle:

    .. literalinclude:: ../example_snippets/nearest_neighbor_finder.py
       :lines: 11-21

    In addition, the class provides the :py:meth:`find_at` method, which determines the *N* nearest particles around some
    arbitrary spatial location:

        Returns an iterator that visits the *N* nearest neighbors of the given particle in order of ascending distance.

        :param int index: The zero-based index of the central particle whose neighbors should be determined.
        :returns: A Python iterator that visits the *N* nearest neighbors of the central particle in order of ascending distance.
                  For each neighbor being visited, the iterator returns an object having the following attributes:

                      * **index**: The global index of the current neighbor particle.
                      * **distance**: The distance of the current neighbor from the central particle.
                      * **distance_squared**: The squared neighbor distance.
                      * **delta**: The three-dimensional vector connecting the central particle with the current neighbor (correctly taking into account periodic boundary conditions).

        The index can be used to look up properties of the neighbor particle, as demonstrated in the first example code above.

        Note that several periodic images of the same particle may be visited if the periodic simulation cell is sufficiently small.
        Then the same particle index will appear more than once in the neighbor list. In fact, the central particle may be among its own neighbors in a sufficiently small periodic simulation cell.
        However, the computed neighbor vector (`delta`) will be unique for each image of a neighboring particle.

        The number of neighbors actually visited may be smaller than the requested number, *N*, if the
        system contains too few particles and is non-periodic.

        Note that the :py:meth:`!find()` method will not find other particles located exactly at the same spatial position as the central particle for technical reasons.
        To find such particles too, which are positioned exactly on top of each other, use :py:meth:`.find_at` instead.

        particles at once, without explicit for-loop and by making use of all parallel processor cores.

        ``neigh_idx`` : NumPy array of shape (*M*, *N*) storing the indices of neighbor particles, 
        with *M* equal to *len(indices)* or, if *indices* is *None*, the total number of particles in the system. 
        *N* refers to the number of nearest neighbors requested in the :py:class:`NearestNeighborFinder` constructor. 
        The computed indices in this array can be used to look up properties of neighbor particles in the global :py:class:`Particles` object.

        ``neigh_vec`` : NumPy array of shape (*M*, *N*, 3) storing the xyz components of the three-dimensional neighbor vectors ("delta"), 
        which connect the *M* central particles with their *N* respective nearest neighbors. 

        :param indices: List of zero-based particle indices for which the neighbor lists should be computed.
